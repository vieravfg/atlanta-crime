# Atlanta Crime Analysis

### Description:
Analyzed Atlanta crime data from 2009 to 2019 and 2020 to 2021. We identified crime patterns for different years, neighborhoods and zipcodes. We also used data from 2009-2019 to perform time series forecasting that predicted the number of crimes that would occur on a given day.
